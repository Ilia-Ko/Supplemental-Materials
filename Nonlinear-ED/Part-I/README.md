Folder 'Supplemental-Materials/Nonlinear-ED/Part-I/' contains wxMaxima scripts
supporting the article '*On resonant generation of electromagnetic modes in nonlinear
electrodynamics. Part 1: Classical approach*'.

**Section 4.1**   One-dimensional cavity  / Single pump mode.   Use script '*(Section 4.1)   1D-Cavity Mono.wxmx*'

**Section 4.2**   One-dimensional cavity  / Two pump modes.     Use script '*(Section 4.2)   1D-Cavity Duo.wxmx*'

**Section 5.1**   Rectangular cavity      / Single pump mode.   Use script '*(Section 5.1)   3D-Cavity Mono.wxmx*'

**Section 5.2**   Rectangular cavity      / Two pump modes.     Use script '*(Section 5.2)   3D-Cavity Duo.wxmx*'

**Section 5.2.1** Rectangular cavity      / Two pump modes / Resonant solution for the 2 w1 - w2 signal mode. 
                                                                Use script '*(Section 5.2.1) 3D-Cavity Duo Special.wxmx*'

Generally, the scripts are designed to be easily configurable: the last three scripts slightly differ from each other
on initalisation stage, as well as the first two ones. For convenience and simplicity, the individual copies have been
made and set up for corresponding sections.

**Dependency**: all scripts rely on 'VCALC.MAC' package for CAS Maxima. File 'vcalc.mac' should be present either among
maxima's search directories or besides the scripts.
