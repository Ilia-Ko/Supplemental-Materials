Folder 'Supplemental-Materials/Nonlinear-ED/Part-I/' contains wxMaxima scripts
supporting the article '*On resonant generation of electromagnetic modes in nonlinear
electrodynamics. Part 1: Classical approach*'.

**Section 4.1**   One-dimensional cavity  / Single pump mode.   Use script '*(Section 4.1)   1D-Cavity Mono.wxmx*'

**Section 4.2**   One-dimensional cavity  / Two pump modes.     Use script '*(Section 4.2)   1D-Cavity Duo.wxmx*'

**Section 5.1**   Rectangular cavity      / Single pump mode.   Use script '*(Section 5.1)   3D-Cavity Mono.wxmx*'

**Section 5.2**   Rectangular cavity      / Two pump modes.     Use script '*(Section 5.2)   3D-Cavity Duo.wxmx*'

**Section 5.2.1** Rectangular cavity      / Two pump modes / Resonant solution for the 2 w1 - w2 signal mode. 
                                                                Use script '*(Section 5.2.1) 3D-Cavity Duo Special.wxmx*'

Generally, the scripts are designed to be easily configurable: the last three scripts slightly differ from each other
on initalisation stage. For convenience the individual copies have been made and configured for corresponding sections.
